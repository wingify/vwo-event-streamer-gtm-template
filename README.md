# VWO Event Streamer GTM Template

VWO Event Streamer is a custom tag template that you can import into your GTM account in order to stream custom events from GTM to VWO. This is an effortless approach if you just require fetching custom events from GTM to VWO. You just need to install the VWO streamer as a template on GTM and configure the events to be sent to VWO from GTM. 

### The following features are available :

2. Option to exclude events from being sent to VWO.
3. Option to exclude properties from being sent to VWO.
